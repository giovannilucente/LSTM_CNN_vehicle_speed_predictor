## Installation and Setup

To install and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/giovannilucente/LSTM_CNN_vehicle_speed_predictor.git
cd LSTM_CNN_vehicle_speed_predictor
```
### 2. Install the requirements
Install all the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the NGSIM dataset
Navigate to the NGSIM folder and download the NGSIM trajectory dataset (in .txt format) from the official site:
```bash
cd NGSIM
# Download here the trajectory dataset in .txt format
cd ..
```
Note: Please ensure that you download the dataset into the NGSIM folder.

### 4. Convert the dataset
Once the dataset is downloaded, use the provided Python script to convert the raw NGSIM dataset into a format that can be used for training. Run the following command:
```bash
python3 NGSIM_dataset_converter.py
```
A file called NGSIM_data.pkl will be created, containing the converted dataset in a Python pickle format.

### 5. Launch the training
Now you can train the model using the following command:
```bash
python3 training.py
```
The model will train, and the best-performing model will be saved in a folder called model.
